# Green-Stocks

## Overview
This analysis was created to track trading volume and prices for 12 stocks of interest.
The macro tool loops through each ticker, collecting it's start price, end price, and volume then displaying it on a new page.

## Results

I added a macro button for the original code and another button to clear the output.

Then I refactored the code to loop through the tickers and input into arrays to store the data. Final data output for the refactor is all at once. This greatly increased the speed of the code running.
